# Distance metric learning in Python

## Algorithms

This python module implements two distance metric learning algorithms for learning metrics from pairwise similarity constraints:

- Pairwise constrained component analysis (PCCA) [[1]]
- Cross model metric learning (CMML) [[2]]

## Disclaimer

This code has been re-written from scratch and is mainly untested. 

## Usage condition

Any publication made using this code or a modification, adaptation or traduction of this code should mention the publications [[1]] and [[2]]
